/home/ann/pd101/noon50/readme.txt

The files in this folder are directed at the effort of predicting the
next one day pctgain for GSPC.

To get the most recent prediction I should follow these steps:

- Install the pd101 repo here: /home/ann/pd101

- This shell command should then work:
  head /home/ann/pd101/noon50/readme.txt

- Next cd to this folder:
  /home/ann/pd101/noon50/

- Then wait until 10 minutes before market close M-F.

- In California that would be 12:50 pm.

- Next, type this shell command:

- /home/ann/pd101/noon50/noon50.bash

- The above script should get the data it needs and then it should
  calculate the most recent prediction.

- The prediction is predicting the one day pctgain for GSPC between today's
  market close and the next market close.
