/home/ann/pd101/plot/demo_data/readme.txt

The data in this folder was created by this script:

/home/ann/pd101/plot/plot.bash

The above script placed the data in this folder:

/tmp/pd101/

Then I copied the files in that folder into this folder:

/home/ann/pd101/plot/demo_data/

These files are interesting:
